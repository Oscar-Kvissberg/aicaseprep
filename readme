This is what needs to be in the .env.local file in the main folder... 
(not in the app folder!!!)

Maby not everything is needed, but this is what I have so far... hehe

:

# Google OAuth Configuration
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=

# NextAuth Configuration
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
NEXTAUTH_URL=

to copy this shit code into another repo... just write the following in your terminal: 

git remote add other-repo https://github.com/oscar-kvissberg/frame.git
git fetch other-repo
git merge --allow-unrelated-histories other-repo/main



to manage stripe :
After setting this up, try making a purchase again. The Stripe CLI will forward the webhook to your local server, and you should see the logs in your terminal.
If you prefer to deploy to a public URL, you can:
Deploy your app to Vercel
Go to the Stripe Dashboard > Developers > Webhooks
Add a new webhook endpoint: https://your-app-url.vercel.app/api/webhooks
Select the event: checkout.session.completed
Copy the signing secret and update your .env.local file
Let me know which approach you'd prefer, and I'll help you set it up.





för cli för betalning till local server
stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks
